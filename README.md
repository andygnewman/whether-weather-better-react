# whether-weather-better-react

Version of a [VueJS app](https://github.com/andygnewman/whether-weather-api) rewritten in React.

The app compares the current and forecast temperature across three locations (where family are) and determines where it is warmest currently and where it is forecast to be warmest.

The app updates the values every 30 minutes and re-runs the comparison.

It gets the weather data from an intermediary API I also built, that can be found at this [repo](https://github.com/andygnewman/whether-weather-api).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
